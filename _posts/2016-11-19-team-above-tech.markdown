TL;DR
=====
Working agile projects means working more with people than working with technologies.

Doing waterfall then doing agile.
===

I work in a consulting company. I am a .Net architect and Web developer for about 10 years in this company. 
Before 2013, those projects were exclusively done in waterfall. 
Sometimes iterative waterfall until that crucial year of 2013 and that crucial 'PMA' project that was done with all best practices for the first time (for me): TDD, pair programming but especially agile/scrum.

That was my first time doing agile. It was also the first project during which, when I woke up in the morning, I was more than glad and enthousiastic to go to work.

Just so you know, agile projects in a good team makes you happy !

In consulting companies...
===

In consulting companies, there are always a number of projects going on. 
Always delays in starting up a new project, always need of people with skill X or Y to go in project team A or B or for customer C or D. 
It means that most of the time, when working in a team or growing a team, you have to accept the fact that this team is effemeral.

I have been fighting against disassembling teams since 2013. After this successful 'PMA' project, we have had other successful projects, needing to grow the team size, but eventually the larger projects came to an end and voil√†... 
Bench time. That is when the bad thing starts to happen.

Imagine being a manager in a consulting company. 
You have skilled consultants on the bench on one side and you have projects or customers in need of skilled consultants on the other side. What do you do?
Well I guess you would do what my manager did: split the team. Take a/some consultant(s) that are available and move them to other teams, or send them temporarily doing bodyshopping.

Now I strongly believe that the hard part of projects lies in the people interactions, in the practices you implement and follow more than in the technology you use and master.

I made this point many times but this year I set myself to prove it to my manager.

Being the member of the Agile.Net team, for 10 years, my specialty is mainly in Microsoft technologies but this year my team and I have successfully implemented a sharepoint project and a nodejs + react project on top of our regular Web + .Net stack projects.


The big leap
===

It is now time to take the ultimate step (for me). I will soon start on a Java project. With my team (even if again slightly modified). I hope to finally demonstrate that indeed, it is the people that matters, not the technologies you master. Of course being an architect means that I am used to master all the aspects on the things that I work with, which will not be the case in this time (Can anyone learn ALL java stuff in a month ?) but I think relying on good team members and proven practices will more then compensate for it.

See you in a month or 3 for more on this new project.
