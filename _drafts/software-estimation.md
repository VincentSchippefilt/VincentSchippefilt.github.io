Before any project start, there is usually a person or a group of people that will try to divine the size of the project.

Usually, there is also tension between the different people interested in this estimation:

- The development team will want to spend as much time as possible to deliver an estimation that is more accurate
- The sales person will want the lowest price possible to be competitive (or to have good margins)
- The resource planner will not commit to who will actually work on the project
- The manager will want the number right now: *first* not to spend too much time (thus not too much money) on estimating, second to quickly have a idea of the size and adapt the planning with the resource planner.
